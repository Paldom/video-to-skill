description: Publishes this Agent Skills repository to skills.sh - pre-flight checks, public visibility flip, protections (PVR, ruleset), consumer-style install verification, telemetry seeding, and repo-page groupings. Use when the user asks to publish, deploy, release, go public, or get listed on skills.sh. Not for authoring skills or editing scaffold infrastructure.

# publish-repo

Deploys this repository to the skills.sh ecosystem. There is no publish API —
deployment = a public, installable repo plus a first install that seeds the
catalogue telemetry. This skill makes that sequence deliberate instead of ad hoc.
Slash-invoked only: it flips repository visibility, which is hard to undo socially
(anything ever pushed becomes visible).

## When NOT to use

- Writing or fixing a skill → `add-skill`.
- The repo has zero skills under `skills/` → build first; never publish an empty
  catalogue.
- Routine pushes to an already-public repo → plain git.

## Workflow

1. **Pre-flight (hard gates — stop on any failure):** the working tree must be
   clean and pushed **by the owner** — this skill never runs `git commit` or
   `git push`; if there are uncommitted changes, stop and hand the list to the
   owner instead.
   ```bash
   git status --porcelain          # must be empty
   make check                      # must end: 0 error(s) — includes skills.sh.json schema shape
   npx skills@latest add . --list  # every skill under skills/ discovered (@latest: a stale npx cache lies)
   gh skill publish --dry-run      # spec validation (needs gh >= 2.90; older gh: skip, use the step-6 fallback)
   env | grep -E 'DISABLE_TELEMETRY|DO_NOT_TRACK|^CI=' || true   # any hit -> the step-7 seed MUST use env -u
   ```
   Triage every `gh skill` warning: add missing `license: MIT` frontmatter; the
   `.claude/skills/` warning is expected here (bundled first-party dev skills,
   committed by design — not third-party content). Those dev skills carry
   `metadata.internal: true`, so consumer installs skip them — they must NOT
   appear in `add . --list`; maintainers opt back in with
   `INSTALL_INTERNAL_SKILLS=1` or `--include-internal`. Also verify: README catalogue
   + CHANGELOG current; every skill description is benefit-led (it is the listing
   copy); CI green on the latest commit.
2. **Manual blockers — require explicit user confirmation, never assume:**
   - full-history secret scan (gitleaks/trufflehog) done;
   - personal/private-file review done (everything ever committed goes public).
   With `--dry-run` in `$ARGUMENTS`, stop here and report readiness instead.
3. **Groupings:** ensure `skills.sh.json` lists every skill in exactly one group
   with an engaging one-sentence description per group (see docs/deploying.md).
4. **Flip visibility** (confirm with the user immediately before):
   ```bash
   gh repo edit <owner>/<repo> --visibility public --accept-visibility-change-consequences
   ```
5. **Protections** (public repo unlocks them):
   ```bash
   gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/private-vulnerability-reporting --method PUT
   ```
   Add a default-branch ruleset. Solo-maintainer default: block force pushes and
   deletions only (a require-PR rule would block the owner's direct-push
   workflow); when outside contributors arrive, upgrade to require-PR +
   code-owner review + the `validate` check. Also add a **tag ruleset** on `v*`
   (block update + deletion) so published releases are immutable.
6. **Release** — cut a versioned GitHub release matching `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`:
   ```bash
   gh skill publish --tag v<version>
   ```
   It re-validates, adds the `agent-skills` topic if missing, and creates the
   release with auto-generated notes. Add the `skills-sh` topic too:
   `gh repo edit <owner>/<repo> --add-topic skills-sh`.
   `gh` < 2.90 has no `gh skill` — equivalent fallback:
   ```bash
   gh release create v<version> --generate-notes
   gh repo edit <owner>/<repo> --add-topic agent-skills --add-topic skills-sh
   ```
7. **Verify like a consumer, and seed the catalogue.** The first real install is
   what lists the repo — and the CLI reports it ONLY when `DISABLE_TELEMETRY`,
   `DO_NOT_TRACK`, and CI variables are all **fully unset** (any value disables,
   even `0` or `false` — env strings are truthy). Run locally, never in CI, with
   the opt-outs explicitly unset for these commands only:
   ```bash
   npx skills@latest add <owner>/<repo> --list
   mkdir -p /tmp/skills-verify && cd /tmp/skills-verify
   env -u DISABLE_TELEMETRY -u DO_NOT_TRACK npx skills@latest add <owner>/<repo> --skill '*' -a claude-code -y
   npx skills list -a claude-code
   ```
   Then confirm the listing: `curl -sIL https://skills.sh/<owner>/<repo>` turns
   200 within minutes of a valid seed (canonical URL is lowercase on
   www.skills.sh; the search API lags the page). Still 404 after ~15 minutes
   means the telemetry never fired — re-check the env, don't wait on "cache".
   Publishing SEVERAL repos? Seed them ONE at a time, ~5 minutes apart, and
   confirm each page before the next: burst install events for multiple
   unlisted repos from one machine are throttled server-side — the security
   audit still runs but the listings never materialize, and re-seeding inside
   the burst does nothing. A single spaced event lists within ~5 minutes.
8. **Polish:** the README carries the skills.sh badge
   (`[![skills.sh](https://skills.sh/b/<owner>/<repo>)](https://skills.sh/<owner>/<repo>)`
   — scaffolded by default); set the homepage (`gh repo edit --homepage`, e.g. to
   `https://skills.sh/<owner>/<repo>`); remind about the social preview image
   (manual UI step).
9. **Report:** repo URL, skills.sh page URL, install command, release tag,
   protections applied, what was skipped (with unlock conditions), and the note
   that the skills.sh page appears after telemetry processes the seed install
   (pages are cached).

## Output spec

Public repo installable via `npx skills add <owner>/<repo>` (verified by an
actual install), PVR enabled, ruleset active, skills.sh.json valid with every
skill grouped, seed install performed, user told exactly what to expect next.

## Gotchas

- Visibility flip is the point of no return for history — that is why step 2
  demands explicit confirmation and never self-certifies.
- `npx skills add . --list` failing with "No skills found" means frontmatter or
  layout problems — fix via `make check` output, never by restructuring blindly.
- **Telemetry opt-outs silently kill the listing**: `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` or
  `DO_NOT_TRACK` set to ANY value (even `0`/`false`) stops the install report —
  the page then 404s forever while every install "succeeds". Always seed via
  `env -u DISABLE_TELEMETRY -u DO_NOT_TRACK`.
- Pin `npx skills@latest` — npx happily reuses a stale cached CLI version.
- The badge endpoint (`skills.sh/b/...`) returns 200 even for unlisted repos —
  it proves nothing; only the repo page URL does.
- The page appears within minutes of a **valid** seed install; the search API
  and leaderboard lag longer. A 404 beyond ~15 minutes = suppressed telemetry
  — or a burst: seeding several unlisted repos back-to-back from one machine
  gets throttled; space seeds ~5 minutes apart, one repo at a time.
- Agent harnesses may permission-block the visibility flip and release
  commands (public-surface actions): hand the exact command to the owner to
  run themselves instead of retrying.
- Do not enable a require-PR ruleset on a solo repo whose workflow pushes to
  main directly — it will block the owner; use the staged default in step 5.
